<h1>AsuraPullUps</h1>
<br>
DISCLAIMER: The macro isn't anything amazing or phenomenal... Its simple and poorly made that took couple hours to create thats why its FREE.<br>
If it doesn't work scroll down to the "Self-Troubleshooting" part and try the methods if nothing works then your pc isn't compatible<br>
Why? i do not know ive tried it on 3 different devices and they all work, i have friends and other people saying that it works<br>
If it doesn't work for you then bad luck you are on your own<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b>
<br>
You will need to download AutoHotkey V1.1 for this to work https://www.autohotkey.com/<br>
After downloading it<br>
You will need to Open the Script and stand near a Pull up bar<br>
Click on the pull up bar and then the pull up bar leave<br>
and then hover your mouse at the pull up bar<br>
then press 'k' this should start the macro<br>
The macro has auto eat so don't worry just make sure you have full hunger bar<br>
This Macro is suited for all resolutions(maybe)<br>
  DO NOT USE MICROSOFT STORE ROBLOX <br>
<br>



<b>Self-Troubleshooting:</b><br>
Roblox chat is not closed, just click on the chat icon on the top left and it should work fine<br>
Hunger Bar not full might potentially cause the macro to freak out<br>
If it says you have no food but you have food try sorting your food inventory in this chronological order<br>
